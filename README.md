# Hello to the reader, I'm Adrián Domínguez Fernández

## About Me

I've been tinkering with computers since I was 10. What started as fixing my own PC has turned into 13 years of hands-on experience with Linux, Windows, scripting, and troubleshooting pretty much everything.

Self-taught system admin looking for my first official IT role in Stockholm. I'm building this portfolio to show what I can actually do, not just what I say I can do.

## What I Work With

**Operating Systems:** Linux (CLI), Windows  
**Scripting:** Python, PowerShell, Bash  
**Other stuff:** VirtualBox, VMware, hardware troubleshooting, basic networking

I'm not claiming to be an expert in everything. I know enough to be dangerous and I learn fast when I need to figure something out.

## Languages

Spanish & Catalan (native) | English (C2) | Swedish (B1) | Portuguese (A2)

Yeah, I speak a few languages. Comes in handy.

## Projects

Building a portfolio of practical scripts and tools. Check back soon. I'm actively working on this.
